# Audio Steganography in Natural Sounds with AES Encryption
This repository contains Python code for implementing audio steganography in natural sounds with encryption. 

## Overview
Audio steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within an audio file. In this project, we demonstrate how to embed encrypted messages into WAV audio files and extract them back, maintaining the confidentiality of the message.

## Features
- Encrypt messages using the cryptography library
- Embed encrypted messages into the LSB of audio frames
- Extract and decrypt messages from audio files

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- cryptography library
